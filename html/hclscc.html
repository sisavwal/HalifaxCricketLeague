<button class="accordion">Club History</button>

<div class="panel">
	<p>Year entered the Halifax Crcket League: 1989</p>

	<p>Although a cricket club was based in Southowram, at the end of Pinnar Lane, before the First World War the
		current Southowram Cricket Club is the youngest club in the Halifax Cricket League, having come into existence
		in 1977 when a meeting in the Cock and Bottle Inn decided that the successful pub team should be transformed in
		to Southowram Cricket Club.</p>

	<p>An application to join the Halifax Association Cricket League was accepted and a new cricket club was born. The
		club secured the use of a council owned ground at Spring Hall where they would remain for the following 4 years.
	</p>

	<p>By 1979 it was clear that the club was attracting a great deal of interest from local players, so the committee
		decided to add a second team. Unfortunately the club was unable to use the ground at Spring Hall as a base for
		the second team so the old ground to the rear of the former New Delight Inn, which was owned by Wainstalls C.C.
		but unused by them, was hired.</p>

	<p>The addition of a second team was an important part of the club&rsquo;s growth and long-term plans. The committee
		had decided that they would apply to join the Halifax Cricket League as soon as all of the qualification
		requirements had been met. The only requirement now was their own permanent ground. A local building supplies
		manufacturer, Marshalls Mono Plc, was approached and they offered the club a site on a former quarry and
		landfill site at Ashday Lane.</p>

	<p>Work started on the ground in early 1982 and was completed in time for the 1983 season. The club acquired a
		pavilion from Barkisland Cricket Club who had built a new stone pavilion the previous year. Unbeknown to the
		club at the time the pavilion had its own history having been sold to Barkisland Cricket Club by the former
		Southowram St Anne&rsquo;s Cricket Club.</p>

	<p>In addition to the pavilion an old pie hut acquired from Halifax Town AFC was converted in to a score box, which
		remained in use until 1987 when it was replaced by a purpose built tackle shed / score box.</p>

	<p>The club continued in the Association League for the next 5 seasons, unsuccessfully applying to join the Halifax
		League at the end of each season. In 1988 Halifax R.A.F.A Cricket Club resigned from the league leaving the way
		open for Southowram to join the league. The opportunity was grabbed with both hands and in the first season the
		club finished mid table in the second division.</p>

	<p>By this time the wooden pavilion, which was later joined by two &lsquo;Portacabins&rsquo;, had fallen in to
		disrepair. The decision was taken to replace them with a new purpose built stone pavilion complete with bar,
		showers and running water (a luxury compared with the current facilities). Tony Cawdry of Yorkshire County
		Cricket Club officially opened the new clubhouse on June 23rd 1993. The day was held around a commemorative
		cricket match between Southowram and a Halifax League select side.</p>

	<p>In the years since Southowram Cricket Club were admitted to the Halifax Cricket League, the club has been noted
		for several firsts, including the first regular female cricketer in the league and the first ground to witness
		six sixes in an over when Fiaz Haider performed the feat in 2001.</p>
