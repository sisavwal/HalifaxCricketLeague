				<ol type="i">
					<li>Should there be persistent inclement weather on the day of a match it may be cancelled by the home club,
						but by no earlier than three hours before the start time, in order to prevent the visiting team and umpires
						making unnecessary journeys. This is on condition that an official or captain of the home club contacts an
						official or captain of the away club and they mutually agree to the cancellation. </li>
					<li>If such an agreement is made then within one hour an email must be sent, by both home and away clubs, to

	<button class="accordion">L8 MATCH PROCEDURES</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<ol type="a">
			<li>All matches shall be played in accordance with the Laws of Cricket except as stated in these Rules. The League
				does not allow underarm bowling through pre-match agreements by captains (Law 21.1.2). The League operates a two
				warning procedure on high, unfair deliveries. The umpire'sinstruction to the captain to suspend a bowler for
				such an offence, is to give one initial warning and, if required a second and final warning, at which point the
				suspension procedure shall be activated. (Laws 41.7.1 & 41.7.2).</li>
			<li>All matches shall start at 1:30pm unless inclement weather intervenes and no match shall commence after
				4:15pm, <span id="ul">noting that the toss must have taken place at least 15 minutes earlier.</span> </li>
			<li>Each First and Second XI shall provide its own ball, which must be new and of standard League issue. All
				reserve balls must also be of standard League issue. All balls shall be submitted to the opposing captain and
				the umpiresfor their approval prior to the commencement of the match. </li>
			<li> Both clubsshall provide a competentscorer for the duration of the match. If no scorer is available for a team
				then one of its players, who shall be a competent scorer, must be appointed. If no such player is available then
				that team shall be deemed to have failed to fulfil the fixture and be fined as per Rule L8(m).
			<li> In every match before the toss is undertaken the umpires shall be provided with an ECBTS showing the names of
				all players. The ages of all players under the age of 19 years, on or before midnight on 31 August of the
				preceding year, must also be shown. Any subsequent change(s) agreed by both captains shall be notified to the
				umpires as soon as possible Any proposed change(s) not agreed by both captains shall be decided by the umpires.
				The names of all players must be recorded in the scorebook, irrespective of whether any play is possible. The
				scorebook entries for both teams must be signed by both umpires at the end of the match with the obtaining of
				such signatures being the responsibility of each team.
			<li> All late starts must be reported immediately to the Fixture Secretary by the umpires and the home club. Any
				offending club may be fined at the discretion of the Executive.
			<li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>A match shall consist of 90 six-ball overs with a tea interval of 30 minutes between innings. The number
						of oversremaining for a team in an inningsshall be exhibited on the scoreboard and shown in descending
						order. </li>
					<li>The team batting first shall occupy no more than 45 overs. The team batting second shall occupy the
						balance of the 90 overs not used by the team batting first with any odd balls bowled being deemed to be a
						complete over. </li>
					<li>Clubsshall make every effort to ensure that grounds are fit for play by the scheduled start time. Any
						decision to play, or not, is totally that of the umpires. In the case of matches where only one League
						umpire is present the decision lies solely with him/her {see Rule L11(c)}. Any attempt to influence such a
						decision by club officials, groundsmen or players will be treated as an offence under Rule L13(a). Bad
						light, lightning or slippery and wet conditions are the main reasons umpiresshall judge that play cannot
						commence, restart or continue. Play shall not proceed under any circumstances if the umpires consider any of
						the above to apply. Where a decision isrequired outside the boundaries of the above criteria,for a
						suspension or resumption of play due to rain, the following shall apply: </li>
				</ol>
				<span id="ul">Suspension of play:</span>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>If a passing shower is of short duration, unless the strength of wind and level of light add to the
						deterioration of the conditions, <em>play shall NOT be suspended immediately.</em></li>
					<li>If, after a short time period or a number of overs, it appears that there is no reasonable expectation of
						the light rain ceasing then <em>play shall be suspended.</em> </li>
					<li>Play, at any time, <span id="ul">shall be suspended immediately</span> if the umpires consider the
						conditions to have become dangerous. </li>
				</ol>
				<span id="ul">Resumption of play:</span>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Play <span id="ul">shall not resume</span> if the umpires consider that conditions are dangerous. </li>
					<li>Play shall resume, provided that both umpires (see above) are agreed that conditions have mproved
						sufficiently, even though rain may still be in the air.</li>
				</ol>
				<span id="ul">Communication:/ <br> At all times the umpires shall inform both team captains of their intentions
					with regard to the continuance, suspension or resumption of play. In the case of the batting team either of
					the players currently batting shall be deemed to be the captain.
			</li>
			<li> Players of the fielding team and the two batsmen shall follow the umpires onto the field of play at the
				commencement of the match and at each subsequent period of play. </li>
			<li> No player, except as a substitute fielder, shall be allowed to take part in a match if they arrive more than
				one hour (60 minutes) after the scheduled start. No player shall be allowed to bowl in any match unless they are
				wearing predominantly white clothing. </li>
			<li> The batting side shall be responsible for organising a search for any ball lost during play, subject to local
				ground notices and Health & Safety regulations.
			<li> An incoming batsman must meet the outgoing batsman on the field of play. </li>
			<li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Should there be any interference through inclement weather, with the innings of either team, a cumulative
						total of 15 minutes per innings may be lost before any reduction in overs or score is enforced. Following
						this initial period of 15 minutes playing time, should there be any such interference with the innings of
						the team batting first, then two overs shall be deducted from the match for each further six minutes period
						of delay. The maximum number of total oversto be deducted shall be 40. The team batting first shall occupy
						no more than half of the total overs agreed for the match. The team batting second may occupy the balance of
						the overs not occupied by the team batting first with any odd balls bowled being deemed to be a completed
						over. </li>
					<li>Where inclement weather intervenes, at the discretion of the umpires, the interval referred to in Rule
						L8(g)(i) may be taken early during which time any deduction of overs will be suspended. </li>
					<li>Should inclement weather interfere with the innings of the team batting second no reduction of oversshall
						take place in the first 15 minutes of stoppage. Following this period one over shall be deducted from the
						innings for every completed three minutes period of delay. The maximum number of overs that can be deducted
						from the inningsshall be 20, including any of those lost at the start of the match. </li>
					<li>If the team batting second has its allocation of overs reduced due to inclement weather the score of the
						first batting team shall be recalculated. This shall be determined by multiplying the total number of overs
						lost to the team batting second by the average runs per over required by the team batting second at the
						closure of the first innings.
					<li>Examples of how this calculation works are as follows noting that the deduction of runs may only take
						place when play has restarted: eg
						<ol type="i">
							<li>If the closure of the first innings is at the end of 45 overs, the average runs per over required
								bythe team batting second is the final total score of the team batting first, divided by 45. eg </li>
							<li>If the team batting first are all out after (say) 37 overs, there shall be 53 overs available to the
								team batting second (45 overs normal allocation plus eight unoccupied by the team batting first). The
								average runs per over required by the team batting second shall be the final total score of the team
								batting first, divided by 53. </li>]
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li> Any club fielding a team comprising less than ten players at the end of any first innings shall be fined
				£10.00 for the first and any second occurrence. Any such contravention must be reported by the umpires to the
				Fixture Secretary within 48 hours. Should any team transgress this Rule on a third occasion in the same season
				it shall be deducted 5 points from both the club’s First and Second XI’s records. Transgressing on any fourth or
				fifth occasion shall result in 10 & 15 points deductions respectively. Should a club be deducted any further
				points it may be required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of the season. If the re- election
				clause is applied and the club isre-elected itsteams shall return to the division they were previously competing
				in, subject to any promotion/relegation movements.</li>
			<li> Any club failing to fulfil a fixture or having less than seven players present at the scheduled start time
				[as per Rule L8(b)] shall forfeit the match, unless unavoidable delays prevail, details of which must be
				conveyed to the opposing team and umpires before the scheduled start time. The umpires shall record the details
				on the MRF. Contravention of this Rule shall result in a fine of £50.00. Any additional costs and the allocation
				of match points shall be determined by the Board after consideration of all the facts and reference to Rule
				L5(n). The fine and any costs shall be paidto the Treasurer within seven days of the Executive decision. </li>
			<li> Covers shall be used when necessary at the instruction ofthe umpires. The home club is responsible for the
				placement of covers which must be completed within five minutes of the above decision of the umpires.</li>
