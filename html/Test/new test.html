                       <li>All matches shall be played in accordance with the Laws of Cricket except as stated in these Rules. The League does not allow underarm bowling through pre-match agreements by captains (Law 21.1.2). The League operates a two warning procedure on high, unfair deliveries. The umpire'sinstruction to the captain to suspend a bowler for such an offence, is to give one initial warning and, if required a second and final warning, at which point the suspension procedure shall be activated. (Laws 41.7.1 & 41.7.2).</li>
                       <li>All matches shall start at 1:30pm unless inclement weather intervenes and no match shall commence after 4:15pm, <span id="ul">noting that the toss must have taken place at least 15 minutes earlier.</span> </li>
                       <li>Each First and Second XI shall provide its own ball, which must be new and of standard League issue. All reserve balls must also be of standard League issue. All balls shall be submitted to the opposing captain and the umpiresfor their approval prior to the commencement of the match. </li>
                       <li> Both clubsshall provide a competentscorer for the duration of the match. If no scorer is available for a team then one of its players, who shall be a competent scorer, must be appointed. If no such player is available then that team shall be deemed to have failed to fulfil the fixture and be fined as per Rule L8(m). 
                       <li> In every match before the toss is undertaken the umpires shall be provided with an ECBTS showing the names of all players. The ages of all players under the age of 19 years, on or before midnight on 31 August of the preceding year, must also be shown. Any subsequent change(s) agreed by both captains shall be notified to the umpires as soon as possible Any proposed change(s) not agreed by both captains shall be decided by the umpires. The names of all players must be recorded in the scorebook, irrespective of whether any play is possible. The scorebook entries for both teams must be signed by both umpires at the end of the match with the obtaining of such signatures being the responsibility of each team.
                       <li> All late starts must be reported immediately to the Fixture Secretary by the umpires and the home club. Any offending club may be fined at the discretion of the Executive. 
                       <li> 
                           <ol type="i">
                               <li>A match shall consist of 90 six-ball overs with a tea interval of 30 minutes between innings. The number of oversremaining for a team in an inningsshall be exhibited on the scoreboard and shown in descending order. </li>
                               <li>The team batting first shall occupy no more than 45 overs. The team batting second shall occupy the balance of the 90 overs not used by the team batting first with any odd balls bowled being deemed to be a complete over. </li>
                               <li>Clubsshall make every effort to ensure that grounds are fit for play by the scheduled start time. Any decision to play, or not, is totally that of the umpires. In the case of matches where only one League umpire is present the decision lies solely with him/her {see Rule L11(c)}. Any attempt to influence such a decision by club officials, groundsmen or players will be treated as an offence under Rule L13(a). Bad light, lightning or slippery and wet conditions are the main reasons umpiresshall judge that play cannot commence, restart or continue. Play shall not proceed under any circumstances if the umpires consider any of the above to apply. Where a decision isrequired outside the boundaries of the above criteria,for a suspension or resumption of play due to rain, the following shall apply: </li>
                           </ol>
                           <span id="ul">Suspension of play:</span>

                               <li>If a passing shower is of short duration, unless the strength of wind and level of light add to the deterioration of the conditions, <em>play shall NOT be suspended immediately.</em></li> 
                               <li>If, after a short time period or a number of overs, it appears that there is no reasonable expectation of the light rain ceasing then <em>play shall be suspended.</em>  </li>
                               <li>Play, at any time, <span id="ul">shall be suspended immediately</span> if the umpires consider the conditions to have become dangerous. </li>
                           </ol>
                           <span id="ul">Resumption of play:</span>

                               <li>Play shall resume, provided that both umpires (see above) are agreed that conditions have mproved sufficiently, even though rain may still be in the air.</li>
                           </ol>
                           <span id="ul">Communication:</span> <br> At all times the umpires shall inform both team captains of their intentions with regard to the continuance, suspension or resumption of play. In the case of the batting team either of the players currently batting shall be deemed to be the captain.</li> 
                       <li> Players of the fielding team and the two batsmen shall follow the umpires onto the field of play at the commencement of the match and at each subsequent period of play. </li>
                       <li> No player, except as a substitute fielder, shall be allowed to take part in a match if they arrive more than one hour (60 minutes) after the scheduled start. No player shall be allowed to bowl in any match unless they are wearing predominantly white clothing. </li>
                       <li> The batting side shall be responsible for organising a search for any ball lost during play, subject to local ground notices and Health & Safety regulations. 
                       <li> An incoming batsman must meet the outgoing batsman on the field of play. </li>
                       <li> 
                           <ol type="i">
                               <li>Should there be any interference through inclement weather, with the innings of either team, a cumulative total of 15 minutes per innings may be lost before any reduction in overs or score is enforced. Following this initial period of 15 minutes playing time, should there be any such interference with the innings of the team batting first, then two overs shall be deducted from the match for each further six minutes period of delay. The maximum number of total oversto be deducted shall be 40. <em>The team batting first shall occupy no more than half of the total overs agreed for the match.</em> The team batting second may occupy the balance of the overs not occupied by the team batting first with any odd balls bowled being deemed to be a completed over. </li>
                               <li>Where inclement weather intervenes, at the discretion of the umpires, the interval referred to in Rule L8(g)(i) may be taken early during which time any deduction of overs will be suspended. </li>
                               <li>Should inclement weather interfere with the innings of the team batting second no reduction of oversshall take place in the first 15 minutes of stoppage. Following this period one over shall be deducted from the innings for every completed three minutes period of delay. The maximum number of overs that can be deducted from the inningsshall be 20, including any of those lost at the start of the match. </li>
                               <li>If the team batting second has its allocation of overs reduced due to inclement weather the score of the first batting team shall be recalculated. This shall be determined by multiplying the total number of overs lost to the team batting second by the average runs per over required by the team batting second at the closure of the first innings. 
                               <li>Examples of how this calculation works are as follows noting that the <span id="ul">deduction of runs may only take place when play has restarted:</span> eg 
                                   <ol type="i">
                                       <li>If the closure of the first innings is at the end of 45 overs, the average runs per over required bythe team batting second is the final total score of the team batting first, divided by 45. eg </li>
                                       <li>If the team batting first are all out after (say) 37 overs, there shall be 53 overs available to the team batting second (45 overs normal allocation plus eight unoccupied by the team batting first). The average runs per over required by the team batting second shall be the final total score of the team batting first, divided by 53. </li>]
                                   </ol>
                               </li>
                           </ol>
                      </li>
                       <li> Any club fielding a team comprising less than ten players at the end of any first innings shall be fined £10.00 for the first and any second occurrence. Any such contravention must be reported by the umpires to the Fixture Secretary within 48 hours. Should any team transgress this Rule on a third occasion in the same season it shall be deducted 5 points from both the club’s First and Second XI’s records. Transgressing on any fourth or fifth occasion shall result in 10 & 15 points deductions respectively. Should a club be deducted any further points it may be required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of the season. If the re- election clause is applied and the club isre-elected itsteams shall return to the division they were previously competing in, subject to any promotion/relegation movements.</li>
                       <li> Any club failing to fulfil a fixture or having less than seven players present at the scheduled start time [as per Rule L8(b)] shall forfeit the match, unless unavoidable delays prevail, details of which must be conveyed to the opposing team and umpires before the scheduled start time.

To determine ties for the First Round of the Parish Cup the numbers of each team shall be drawn in pairs from one bag, with the tie played on the ground of the team drawn first in the paring. Where a club is only entering a team in the Parish Cup the list of club names shall show that club as ‘Club X/Bye” to facilitate the Crossley Shield draw (see below). If the total number of teams entered is an odd number under 32 the odd team(s) drawn last shall receive a bye.

The team(s) receiving a bye in the Parish Cup shall be placed (drawn) in one (or both) bags. The draw shall then take place with teams drawn from the ‘home’ and ‘away’ bags alternately until the appropriate number of ties has been determined. The last team(s) in the (two) bags will receive the necessary bye(s). For ties in all subsequent rounds, except the Final, any club whose First XI is drawn at home in the Parish Cup shall be placed in the designated ‘away’ bag. Further teams shall be added to this bag, drawn at random, until both bags contain an equal number of teams with the identity of these teams being undisclosed. The draw for the appropriate round shall then take place as above.</li>

The target score shall then be reduced by the number of overs lost, multiplied by the scoring rate of the team batting first. See Rule K6(d) for minimum overs.<br>

This is now a 40 overs per side game and, with 18 overs having already been bowled, 22 overs remain therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 8. eg ii) Should three bowlers have bowled their nine overs and 60 minutes are lost, therefore 10 overs are lost. This is now a 35 overs per side game and, with 27 having already been bowled, 8 oversremain and therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 4. The same calculation may also be used in the second innings. A part bowled over is considered complete for these calculations.
