            <li>The competitions shall be called the Parish Cup (Cup) and Crossley Shield (Shield) and be knockout
                competitions comprising of 45 overs per team. Except where inappropriate, League Rulesshall apply plus
                the specific ones provided herein.</li>
            <li>All clubs shall enter First XI’s and, where applicable Second XI’s, in the competitions. Clubs opting
                NOT to compete in the Crossley Shield must advise the Fixture Secretary by the specified date in
                January, prior to the February Council Meeting. The Executive will notify the January deadline date to

    <div class="panel">
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Following the publication of the fixtures for any external inter-league competitions the Fixture
                Secretary shall set the schedule for the competitions. Dates shall be published for each round to
                include a Scheduled Date (SD) plus a Reserve Date (RD) with all ties played on a Sunday.</li>
            <li>The Executive shall be responsible for making the draw for the First Rounds at the February Council
                Meeting and, for all subsequent draws, atseparate meetings. Should the number of competing teams in
                either competition exceed 32 then a Preliminary Round, drawn from all competing teams, shall take place
                to reduce the First Round qualifiers to 32. To determine ties for the First Round of the Parish Cup the
                numbers of each team shall be drawn in pairs from one bag, with the tie played on the ground of the team
                drawn first in the paring. Where a club is only entering a team in the Parish Cup the list of club names
                shall show that club as ‘Club X/Bye” to facilitate the Crossley Shield draw (see below). If the total
                number of teams entered is an odd number under 32 the odd team(s) drawn last shall receive a bye. To
                determine ties for the First Round of the Crossley Shield, including those shown as ‘Club X/Bye’, the
                numbers of the teams drawn at home in the First Round of the Parish Cup shall be placed in a designated
                ‘away’ bag and those drawn away from home in that competition shall be placed in a designated ‘home’
                bag. The team(s) receiving a bye in the Parish Cup shall be placed (drawn) in one (or both) bags. The
                draw shall then take place with teams drawn from the ‘home’ and ‘away’ bags alternately until the
                appropriate number of ties has been determined. The last team(s) in the (two) bags will receive the
                necessary bye(s). For ties in all subsequent rounds, except the Final, any club whose First XI is drawn
                at home in the Parish Cup shall be placed in the designated ‘away’ bag. Further teams shall be added to
                this bag, drawn at random, until both bags contain an equal number of teams with the identity of these
                teams being undisclosed. The draw for the appropriate round shall then take place as above.</li>
            <li>The League shall receive the whole of the receipts for the Final ties, from which it shall pay any
                incurred expenses. If a Final tie is postponed, due to inclement weather, the League shall indemnify the
                hostsfor all reasonable expenses incurred. (d) Any monetary loss on a tie shall be shared equally by the
                competing clubs except as provided in Rule K2(c)</li>

                Maximum overs per bowler are as Rule K6(c). The minimum overs for a tie shall be ten overs per team with
                both having the opportunity to bat for its ten overs for a tie to be deemed to have taken place.<br>
                Interrupted in the second innings: Should inclement weather interrupt the second inningsthen the average
                runs per over of the team batting first shall be calculated by taking the number of runs scored and
                dividing by the number of overs faced. Five overs shall be deducted for every 30 minutes lost on a
                cumulative basis. The target score shall then be reduced by the number of overs lost, multiplied by the
                scoring rate of the team batting first. See Rule K6(d) for minimum overs.<br>
                Overs allocation of a bowler if tie interrupted Should inclement weather interrupt an innings before a
                bowler’s allocation has been completed then the following calculation shall be made: the revised total
                number of overs for the inningsshall be divided by five to give an allocation of overs per bowler. <br>
                Examples: eg i) Should two bowlers bowl their allocated nine overs and the innings loses 30 minutes,
                then five overs are deducted. This is now a 40 overs per side game and, with 18 overs having already
                been bowled, 22 overs remain therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 8. eg ii)
                Should three bowlers have bowled their nine overs and 60 minutes are lost, therefore 10 overs are lost.
                This is now a 35 overs per side game and, with 27 having already been bowled, 8 oversremain and
                therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 4. The same calculation may also be used in
                the second innings. A part bowled over is considered complete for these calculations.
