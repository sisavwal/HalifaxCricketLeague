                                divisions of both the First and Second XI’s existing at that time. The only exception
                                shall be in the case of a former League club relegated from the PSW, and in such
                                circumstances both its First and Second XI’s shall be restored to the division in which
                                they were playing in the year of leaving. Any club returning to the League from the PSW

                            </li>
                            <li>A club accepting a promotion offer from the PSW shall be aware that it if returns to the

                            </li>
                            <li>Any club resigning from the League shall inform the Secretary, in writing, by no later
                                than 30 September to enable it to leave the League prior to the commencement of the
                                following season. No club shall negotiate with another league with the intention of
                                considering joining that league without first obtaining permission, in writing, from the

                                membership. If the League does not provide the necessary written permission within 14
                                days then the club shall have the right of appeal to the YCB. Permission to negotiate
                                shall not be interpreted as resignation or dismissal but should the date of 30
                                September, that by which resignations are due to be received, pass without further
                                written notification of action from the club then the above written permission is deemed
                                spent.

                                    First & Second XIs on the provided official form and signed by the club secretary

                                    of the season then any late return shall be disqualified. For the batting, bowling
                                    and wicketkeeping awards the AS shall refer to the Website Statistics (WS) and
                                    produce full qualifying details. Should the award for the individual wicketkeeping
                                    or fielding trophies result in a tie then the higher number of stumpings
                                    (wicketkeeping) or catches (fielding) shall decide the winner. In the event that the
                                    figures for either award are still tied then the trophy shall be shared. The
                                    finalised details shall then be submitted to all clubs by the AS for checking with a
                                    specified deadline for any query to be advised. The AS has the authority to request
                                    any club to make any hard copy scorebook, still in use, to be made available should
                                    any problem arise with the LWS. Should a player transfer from one club to another in

                                its entirety. Any full pitch delivery over waist height shall be called a No Ball but no
                                further penalty shall ensue unless the umpire considers it is unfair and/or dangerous,

                                being issued. Should there be a second and similar such occurrence by the same player
                                he/she shall be immediately suspended from bowling for the remainder of the match.
                                However, should at any time the umpire considers a full pitch delivery over waist height
                                to be deliberate and malicious the official warning, shown above, shall be dispensed

                                when his/her team is batting he/she shall be allowed to participate should a competent
                                alternative player take over the scoring duties. Additionally, should a competent scorer
                                be located during the match and be able to take up duties the player scoring may resume
                                his/her place in the team at any time. If no such player is available then that team

                                        offence under Rule L13(a). Bad light, lightning or slippery and wet conditions
                                        are the main reasons umpires shall judge that play cannot commence, restart or

                                for every 30 minutes lost on a cumulative basis. The target score shall then be
                                reduced by the number of overs lost, multiplied by the scoring rate of the team

                                Should inclement weather interrupt an innings before a bowler’s allocation has
                                been completed then the following calculation shall be made: the revised total
                                number of overs for the innings shall be divided by five to give an allocation
                                of overs per bowler.
                                <br>Examples:
                                <ol class="hcl-rule__panel--list-sub">

                                        30 minutes, then five overs are deducted. This is now a 40 overs per
                                        side game and, with 18 overs having already been bowled, 22 overs remain
                                        therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 8.

                                        lost, therefore 10 overs are lost. This is now a 35 overs per side game
                                        and, with 27 having already been bowled, 8 overs remain and therefore
                                        the maximum number of overs per bowler will now be 4. The same
                                        calculation may also be used in the second innings. A part bowled over
                                        is considered complete for these calculations.
