                                days then the club shall have the right of appeal to the YCB. Permission to negotiate
                                shall not be interpreted as resignation or dismissal but should the date of 30
                                September, that by which resignations are due to be received, pass without further
                                written notification of action from the club then the above written permission is deemed
                                spent.

                                    and wicketkeeping awards the AS shall refer to the Website Statistics (WS) and
                                    produce full qualifying details. Should the award for the individual wicketkeeping
                                    or fielding trophies result in a tie then the higher number of stumpings
                                    (wicketkeeping) or catches (fielding) shall decide the winner. In the event that the
                                    figures for either award are still tied then the trophy shall be shared. The
                                    finalised details shall then be submitted to all clubs by the AS for checking with a
                                    specified deadline for any query to be advised. The AS has the authority to request
                                    any club to make any hard copy scorebook, still in use, to be made available should
                                    any problem arise with the LWS. Should a player transfer from one club to another in

                                Law 41.7. This Law, regarding dangerous and high non-¬pitching deliveries, applies in
                                its entirety. Any full pitch delivery over waist height shall be called a No Ball but no
                                further penalty shall ensue unless the umpire considers it is unfair and/or dangerous,

                                being issued. Should there be a second and similar such occurrence by the same player
                                he/she shall be immediately suspended from bowling for the remainder of the match.
                                However, should at any time the umpire considers a full pitch delivery over waist height
                                to be deliberate and malicious the official warning, shown above, shall be dispensed

                                be submitted to the opposing captain and the umpires for their approval prior to the
                                commencement of the match.

                                be appointed. That player shall not participate in the match when his/her team is
                                fielding and no interchange of scorers shall be allowed during the innings. However,
                                when his/her team is batting he/she shall be allowed to participate should a competent
                                alternative player take over the scoring duties. Additionally, should a competent scorer
                                be located during the match and be able to take up duties the player scoring may resume
                                his/her place in the team at any time. If no such player is available then that team
                                shall be deemed to have failed to fulfil the fixture and be fined as per Rule L8(m).

                                on or before midnight on 31 August of the preceding year, must also be shown. Any

                                possible. Any proposed change(s) not agreed by both captains shall be decided by the

                                        umpires. In the case of matches where only one League umpire is present the
                                        decision lies solely with him/her {see Rule L11(d)}. Any attempt to influence

                                        offence under Rule L13(a). Bad light, lightning or slippery and wet conditions
                                        are the main reasons umpires shall judge that play cannot commence, restart or
